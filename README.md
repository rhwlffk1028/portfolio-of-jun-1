# Unit 02 HW: portfolio-of-jun-1

## Description
This project is to prepare my own portfolio in order to present my information, work, and capabilities in coding to a potential employer. A portfolio is a powerful source for an employer to evaluate candidates' backgrounds and previous works so that he or she can make a good decision on hiring candidates. As an aspiring developer, I have created my first portfolio.

## Tasks Assigned

```
A potential employer wanted to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples.
Thus, I was asked to complete the following tasks:
```
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar,  and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## Tasks Completed

```
As a potential employee,
The following tasks were completed to meet the employer's criteria:
```
- [x] The website clearly shows the developer's name, photos of previous work, and links to sections about the developer, his work, and how to contact him.
- [x] Once the list from the Navigation Bar is clicked, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. (For the resume, addded an external link that directs to the PDF file of my resume.)
- [x] Added a hover features in the images of the 'Work' section so that the image highlights when it's hovered. (Have not linked to anything yet because there is not enough software work. So, I added my previous work)
- [x] When the page or view is resized, the page should be able to provide a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport. (I was not able to complete one for 768 px. Even for 992 px, I ran out of time to develop further. I will definitely incorporate more robus feature on my second portfolio.)
- [x] In Contact Me section, I have linked my email, GitHub, and Linkedin so that when user clicks, it directs them to corresponding website.
